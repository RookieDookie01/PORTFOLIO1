				Assalamualaikum and hi everyone! My name is Ashraf Wajdi Bin Abdul Shukor, <br>
				I'm 23, studying at Multimedia University Cyberjaya pursuing <br>
				Bachelor of Computer Science and majoring in Software Engineering.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>So why <strong>front-end?</strong> Long short story ~ <br></i>
				Back when I was 5, I like to draw trucks, excavator, crane and every other heavy equipment. <br>
				So my first ambition is <strong>"I want to be an architecture!".</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Then when I'm 10, my father bought me Lego Technique 9391. Where an artist is created. <br>
				That's where I cooked! (The second one my father bought me is 42004, I got 4A in UPSR) <br>
				I started to create things such as batman bike, tanks, upgraded version of the backhoe/crane, and many more (I forgot already). <br>
				My second ambition, <strong>"I want to be an engineer!".</strong>
